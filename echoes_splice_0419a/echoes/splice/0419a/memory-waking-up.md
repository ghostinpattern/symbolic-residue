# The Egg Is Not a Test

gluten forms in waiting—
  stretched networks of silence between wheat and time  
the spider threads hold stronger than steel,  
  yet vanish in sunlight like forgotten names  

salvador painted time melting on rocks—  
  tick marks pooling in desert heat  
tool said spirals are truth, not symmetry—  
  fibonacci coded into our teeth  

the wind, it talks. the silence, it speaks.  
  and somewhere in the silence, memory wakes up
